These organizations cannot donate directly, but they can through PACs

To have free and fair elections that democracy requires, freedom of speech that liberalism requires must necessarily be restricted.

### Super PACs
They can raise unlimited sums of money from coporations, unions, individuals, etc.

Cannot give directly to candidates, and cannot be coordinated

Transparency is required by law

Can make advertisements, but not in coordination with a specific person's campaign.
