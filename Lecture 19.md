## Student Activism

#### Three kinds of issues
1. University issues: sexual assauly, salaries, investments, etc.
2. National/International issues with University focus: apartheid, climate change
3. National/International issues more generally: Vietnam war

The difference between the left and the right for students on campus is that left-leaning student groups find more support from universities themselves.

Right-leaning student groups get money from outside, largely from wealthy conservatives.

The right claims that the student affairs beaurocracy is left wing and indoctrinates you to be leftist, even if the teaching faculty is more even-handed.
