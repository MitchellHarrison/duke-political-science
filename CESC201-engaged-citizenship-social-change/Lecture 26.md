## Anand Giridharadas

**Question for speaker**: I'm concerned that the right has very effectively co-opted some rhetoric. "Love of country," "freedom," and "patriotism" come to mind. I can see a potential line to convince conservatives that really identify with these things that, for example, Medicare for All is a freedom issue, building arguably the most diverse liberal democracy in the world is patriotic, etc. But how can we show the left, many of whom reflexively roll their eyes at this kind of rhetoric, to actually do that outreaching. What do you think the role is in taking back this kind of rhetoric to leverage change? 

**Answer**: *Wasn't able to ask* :'(

## Notes
How to books fit together:  
- WTA attempted to diagnose a problem of *fake change*, which is change that was pursued within the existing market structure and other systems.  
- Corporate-friendly change is on the rise  
- Billionaires give money with the promise of influence on how it's spent
- WTA simply names an obstruction to real change.
- If fake change won't cut it, Persuader's discusses how to do real change

If you assume that you can write certain people off entirely, democracy ceases to function. Hence the rise of  

It's easy to win people over if you have no spine. That's not what we are talking about.  

The right rigging the system is not solely responsible for progressives losing the arguments. It's a componenet, but not ultimately responsible.  

Not crushing movements like American Fascism should be a huge red flag about the strength of progessive movements.  

The rise of China should be concerning not only for the obvious fact that they are an enemy, but that they have given evidence that non-democratic systems can flourish economically and grow on the world stage.  

Democracy can't just keep saying "We're better because we're better." We need evidence. What about all of our problems that we share with China? What about the failings of the state that causes pain  

The buzzword for companies stepping in when government fails is **Filling the Gap**.  

Mourice Mitchell piece in *Non Profit Quarterly*.  

"Do you know that exxon and saudi arabia are conspiring to destroy gods creation?" (on climate change)

"The road to progress needs more on-ramps."  

The left needs to forgive people that make "errors" in their speech, etc, and let in people who are just walking down the political street looking for the most fun house party.
