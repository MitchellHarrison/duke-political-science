## COVID (cont'd)
The party one identifies with is the best predictor of their beliefs about the pandemic.

Political party affiliation, post-vaccine, became a risk factor for COVID-19.

**NOTE**: Check on data for whether or not COVID deaths caused different election outcomes during the midterms.

## Populism, deomcracy, and social change
*Anti-populism* is the response that elites have had to the rise of populism

Populism is an essentially-debated concept, and has been for some time.

In defense of populism, one could argue that it is an expression of the grass roots, and is inherently democratic.

Most start with a negative assumption of populism, which can skew public feelings towards populism unjustly.

Populism is, at some level, an attack on intellectual elites.

*When does populism rise?*
- post-2008 crisis
- rare at a time of growth, but possible if high inequality
- anti-deep state
- "those who keep us down are external"
- "return to a Golden Age" (MAGA)
- Not many policies, mostly attacks

Jared Kushner: "Trump took back the country from the doctors" after issuing a re-opening order.

*Left-wing populism* is almost always attacking economic elites
*Right-wing populism* frequently attacks educated elites 

**Populism is anti-pluralist by definition** because the leader of a populist movement claims to speak for the voice of all people.

##### Three kinds of populism
Cultural - see majority ethnic/religious group narratives as the "true people"

Socioeconomic - see the working class as the "true people"

Anti-establishment - see the average citizens without connections as the "true people"
