Q: What is *neoliberalism*?
A: A system that believes in global, unrestricted free trade and capitalism

**Note**: at this moment in American politics, people have begun connecting the rise of right-wing populism with neoliberalism. Why?

Even democrats have embraced neoliberalism, especially with the election of Bill Clinton

## Aanand and Philanthropy
Q: What is *marketworld*?
A: Changing the world while maintaining the status quo.

The hyper-rich give away tons of money every year, and yet their net worth goes up every year by much more.

##### Income inequality is not bad
It produces more overall wealth
It puts funds in the hands of the smartest/most qualified
It may be a natural quality of a country producing more wealth

Win/win is bad. If everyone is winning, not enough changing is being made. Someone is going to lose, you just have to pick the right winners and losers. Right now, the poor lose and the rich win, no matter how much philanthropy.

## Philanthropy and democracy
Q: What is *philanthropy*?
A: Donating or using private funds/charitable contributions to contribute to the public good

Importantly, philanthropic funds are not democratically controlled. Why should Bill Gates have so much influence over K-12 education?
