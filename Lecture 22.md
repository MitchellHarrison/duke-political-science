## Populism (cont'd)
*Anti-globalization*: manufacturing has gone overseas, immigrants lower labor costs, limited life prospects  of low-education and low-skill workers.

##### What is populism?
- necessary but not sufficient to be critical of elites
- anti-pluralist
- *Where does populism end and democracy begin?*

*Questions for populists* (frame of George Wallace):
- Did white life get worse after integration?
- Did straight life get worse after gay marriage was legalized?

"George Wallace speaks for fireman, policemen, working class."

## Race and BLM
The pursuit of change through policy and governance has largely failed (with exceptions of Civil Rights Act and some others)

We are seeing and increase in the number of black conservative republican candidates.

#### Race as an issue
- systemic racism
- critical race theory
- DeSantis on CRT
- defund the police
- black lives matter
- anti-racist

**Note to self**: scrape news sites to count how often political keywords (CRT, BLM, etc) are mentioned over time. Could compare with Google search data to see which drives which.

*Racism can exist without racists*.

Taylor describes racism as "legalized discrimination".
