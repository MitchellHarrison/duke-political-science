General notes:
- Hubs' outward-pointing edges will vary in weight with the trust that that individual puts in them
- Trust in others vs. the news can be judged by comparing sum weights of all inward-facing edges of an individual


Graph parameters:
- Proportion of red/blue nodes
- Number of hubs
- Number of individuals
- Edges between non-hubs are bi-directional
- Hubs have a starting proportion of time they share misinformation
- Misinformation rate of each hub (0 to 1)
- Max number of iterations


Over time:
- Edge weights from individuals to hubs slightly increase
- Individuals with total weight of connection to red hubs of some threshold weaken connection to blue individuals slightly, and vice versa
- Individuals with roughly the same proportion of weights to different color hubs grow in connection to one another
- If an individual has a certain threshold of weight to a single color hub, connection to individual nodes of opposite color is severed with some probability
- If a hub shares misinformation:
    - Individuals whose edge weight to that hub is the strongest of all hubs (by some amount) will increase the weight of that hub's edge
    - Individuals of opposite color drastically lose weight in the edge connecting them to the hub
    - Individuals of the same color and above a weight threshold to that hub that share a connection to each other increase the weight of their connection
    - Individuals with only one connection to any hub will show an *extreme* increase in weight to that hub
- If an individuals total weight to all hubs is low enough, they will connect to a new hub with a constant starting rate
- If an individual has no connection to any hub, they will select a random one of a color that has the highest weight of their connection to other individuals

Stop the simulation when:
- no edge weights change between any two individuals
- a certain number of iterations occurs


Model parameters:
- Weight increase to all hubs per iteration
- Threshold of edge weight to hub that causes a decrease in connection to opposite colors
- Threshold of edge weight to hub that allows for increase
- Probability of a severed connection given opposite colored individuals
- Edge weight lost when opposite color hub exposes them to misinformation
- Edge weight increased between individuals when they trust the same misinformation
- Starting weight of connection to a new hub
- Starting weight of connection to a new individual


Expected output (hypotheses):
- Misinformation sources will control a smaller portion of the viewer market
- Misinformation sources will have a very dedicated, if small, cohort of viewers
- Individuals will be cut off from those of differing color
- An individual will have a more diverse set of social connections to the opposite color
- Social connection between members of a misinformation "echo chamber" will be tighter than others' connections
