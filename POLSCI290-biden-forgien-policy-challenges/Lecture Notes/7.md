# Lecture 7 - Democracy v. Authoritarian
The extraordinary success of Ukraine in the first year of the conflict was in no 
small part due to the political backing by the US and allies. That performance is
not guaranteed in year two, as support for Ukraine dwindles in the West.

Two waves of democracy: First was pre-WWI, where much of Europe slowly began to 
become increasingly democratic. The second happens around the 1960's much of which
was taking place in South America.
