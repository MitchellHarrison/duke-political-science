# Current Foreign Policy Politics
Dissent is not necessarily disloyalty. Debate is critical to all policy, including foreign policy. But it requires all sides to be acting in good faith.

#### Points on bipartisainship
1. Bipartisainship and "politics ends on the water's edge" is the historical exception, not the rule.
2. Some of the worst foreign policy has come from too much concensus.
3. Some of the best policies come from compromise.

The National Security Advisor is potentially the most important member of the President's staff, and is the only foreign policy head that doesn't require Congressional approval.

The National Security Advisor leads the National Security Council ([NSC](https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/))

A key impact on foreign policy decision-making is the fact that social media has massively shrunk the decision-making window. 12 days went by before JFK made a speech about the Cuban missile crisis.

There is a lack of faith in the US partially because our candidates (Obama as the first black president, Trump as Trump) have been so far outside the norm of American politics since its inception.
